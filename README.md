# bamazon-project

 In this project we are going to use MySQL to get a madeup database to be used as a purchase app.

 WARNING --BEFORE YOU DO JAVASCRIPT-- 

Open XAMP and run it, the "MySQL" should look green and it should show the port it's using:

If it says otherwhise please change the Port Number or look for help.


Now let's open MySQL using the port 3307 as stated in XAMPP

Then we can create the database like so:

When this is complete, you can connect everything in javascript, as you can see in my bamazonCustomer.js. To separate it this is the part that actually does the connection.

After this you can follow the bamazonCustomer javascript code that you can call with "node bamazonCustomer.js" and it will present the database in a box edited by the cli-table3 npm.

It will ask you the item of the product you want to buy and how much of it you want.

After this, the app will run again but the items you purchase will be gone from the database, like so:

Have fun with this and remember to ask for help and read the documentation if you get stuck!
